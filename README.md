# uKernel_8051

### tiny RR scheduler for 8051

This implementation can schedule multiple tasks in parallel with the RR preemptive scheluer. For demo, there are 3 different tasks, each blinking differentÂ  LED in infinite loop. Thanks to Keil IDE which provides easy simulation for faster implementation and debugging.
